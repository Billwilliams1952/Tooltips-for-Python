# Text will continue to be appended until the line ends with a dollar sign.
#e.g.,
# 35 : This is some tooltip text. $
# 36 : This text here spans three lines. The amount of text is only limited by python
#      and could be huge. This can go on until a the dollar sign is
#      found. $
# 37 : The next tooltip. Use a newline \n to force a newline in the displayed text. $

# The numbering of the tooltips can be in any order.

101 : This is a tooltip for button 101. $
102 : This is a tooltip for button 102. $

202 : This is a tooltip for checkbutton 202. $
203 : This is a tooltip for checkbutton 203. $
204 : This is a tooltip for checkbutton 204. $

2000 : Enable/disable showing the tip number with the tooltip.\n\n
This is an example of a very long tooltip. The text continues until a
dollar sign is found.\n\n
So add a dollar sign now. $

# There is no tooltip number for 9999
